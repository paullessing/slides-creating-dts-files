# Anything to Declare? -- How to writ your own `@types` files
These are the accompanying slides to one of my talks.

You can find the interactive version at [https://paullessing.github.io/slides-creating-dts-files](https://paullessing.github.io/slides-creating-dts-files).

## Build Process
The slides are built using GitHub Actions and automatically deployed to the `gh-pages` branch.

See the `.github/workflows` directory for details.

## Building locally
TODO: Currently not working since I implemented the Actions.
